# FindThosePods

 This repo contains the code to find pods in cluster.

 Sometimes we have to find pods in different ways while it is troublesome to check the pods one by one or write a process with `client-go` library.

 So every time I have to find certain kind of pods in cluster, I write a shell to make it easy to find those pods.
